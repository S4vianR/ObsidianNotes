## Introduction
### Enumeration Methodology Notes

#### Overview

- **Purpose**: Establish a standardized methodology for complex processes like penetration testing to avoid omissions and ensure thoroughness.
- **Dynamic Nature**: Penetration testing is dynamic; thus, a static enumeration methodology is developed for both external and internal tests.
- **Structure**: The methodology consists of 6 layers, representing metaphorical boundaries in the enumeration process, divided into three levels:
    - Infrastructure-based enumeration
    - Host-based enumeration
    - OS-based enumeration

#### Layers of Enumeration Methodology

1. **Internet Presence**
    
    - **Description**: Identify the company's internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.
    - **Information Categories**: Domains, subdomains, vHosts, ASN, netblocks, IP addresses, cloud instances, security measures.
2. **Gateway**
    
    - **Description**: Identify security measures protecting external and internal infrastructure.
    - **Information Categories**: Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, proxies, NAC, network segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare.
3. **Accessible Services**
    
    - **Description**: Identify accessible interfaces and services hosted externally or internally.
    - **Information Categories**: Service type, functionality, configuration, port, version, interface.
4. **Processes**
    
    - **Description**: Identify internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with services.
    - **Information Categories**: PID, processed data, tasks, source, destination.
5. **Privileges**
    
    - **Description**: Identify internal permissions and privileges for accessible services.
    - **Information Categories**: Groups, users, permissions, restrictions, environment.
6. **OS Setup**
    
    - **Description**: Identify internal components and system setup.
    - **Information Categories**: OS type, patch level, network configuration, OS environment, configuration files, sensitive private files.

#### Methodology Insights

- **Human Aspect**: The human element and OSINT information are excluded from the "Internet Presence" layer for simplicity.
- **Labyrinth Analogy**: The penetration test is likened to navigating a labyrinth, identifying gaps (vulnerabilities) to find entry points.
- **Limitations**: Time constraints limit the ability to identify all vulnerabilities; thorough understanding requires more extensive study.

#### Practical Application

- **External "Black Box" Testing**: Begins after fulfilling contract requirements, focusing on identifying targets in the "Internet Presence" layer.
- **Dynamic Approach**: The methodology is not a rigid step-by-step guide but a systematic approach that evolves with new tools and techniques.
- **Tool Utilization**: Various tools are available for information gathering, each with specific focuses, but the methodology remains a summary of systematic procedures rather than a list of tools.

## Infrastructure Based Enumeration

### Domain Information
#### Online Prescence
The first point of presence on the Internet may be the SSL certificate from the company's main website that we can examine.

Another source to find more subdomains is [Crt.sh](https://crt.sh). This source is Certificate Transparency logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections.

##### Certificate Transparency
We can also output the results in JSON format.

```shell-session
R3ubenR4512@htb[/htb]$ curl -s https://crt.sh/\?q\=inlanefreight.com\&output\=json | jq .

  },
  { ... SNIP ...
```

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

```shell-session

### FTP
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet. The FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack.

#### TFTP
Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it does not provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP.

Let us take a look at a few commands of `TFTP`:

| Commands | Description                                                                                                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| connect  | Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.                                                                     |
| get      | Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.                                                               |
| put      | Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.                                                             |
| quit     | Exits tftp.                                                                                                                            |
| status   | Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on. |
| verbose  | Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.                                             |
Unlike the FTP client, `TFTP` does not have directory listing functionality.

##### Default Configuration
One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions is vsFTPd. The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found in /etc/vsftpd.conf, and some settings are already predefined by default.

###### vsFTPd Config File

```shell-session
R3ubenR4512@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"
```

| **Setting**                                                   | **Description**                                                                                          |

In addition, there is a file called /etc/ftpusers that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service.

##### FTPUSERS

```shell-session
R3ubenR4512@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/ftpusers

guest
john
kevin
```

##### Dangerous Settings
There are many different security-related settings we can make on each FTP server. These can have various purposes, such as testing connections through the firewalls, testing routes, and authentication mechanisms.

| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                                    |

| `anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`  | Allowing anonymous to create new directories?                                      |
| `no_anon_password=YES`         | Do not ask anonymous for password?                                                 |
| `anon_root=/home/username/ftp` | Directory for anonymous.                                                           |
| `write_enable=YES`             | Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE? |

### SMB
`Server Message Block` (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. Information exchange between different system processes can also be handled based on the SMB protocol.

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined by `Access Control Lists` (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such as `execute`, `read`, and `full access` for individual users or user groups.

#### SAMBA
Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol. [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e) is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft.

   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers

```

The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly.

##### Dangerous Settings

| **Setting**                 | **Description**                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseable = yes`          | Allow listing available shares in the current share?                |
| `read only = no`            | Forbid the creation and modification of files?                      |
| `writable = yes`            | Allow users to create and modify files?                             |
| `guest ok = yes`            | Allow connecting to the service without using a password?           |
| `enable privileges = yes`   | Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?                          |
| `create mask = 0777`        | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?       |
| `directory mask = 0777`     | What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories? |
| `logon script = script.sh`  | What script needs to be executed on the user's login?               |
| `magic script = script.sh`  | Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?        |
| `magic output = script.out` | Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?            |

#### Example Share
```shell-session
...SNIP...

[notes]
	comment = CheckIT
	path = /mnt/notes/

	browseable = yes
	read only = no
	writable = yes
	guest ok = yes

	enable privileges = yes
	create mask = 0777
	directory mask = 0777
```

#### SMBclient
##### Connecting to the Share
```shell-session
R3ubenR4512@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. Thereby `print$` and an `IPC$` are already included by default in the basic setting, as we have already seen. Since we deal with the `[notes]` share, let us log in and inspect it using the same client program. If we are not familiar with the client program, we can use the `help` command on successful login, listing all the possible commands we can execute.

```shell-session
R3ubenR4512@htb[/htb]$ smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes

Enter WORKGROUP\<username>'s password: 
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using the `get` command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

The `rpcclient` offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on the [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) of the rpcclient.

```

These examples show us what information can be leaked to anonymous users. Once an `anonymous` user has access to a network service, it only takes one mistake to give them too many permissions or too much visibility to put the entire network at significant risk.

##### Rpcclient - Group Information

```shell-session
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201

        Group Name:     None
        Description:    Ordinary Users
        Group Attribute:7
        Num Members:2
```

However, it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the query `queryuser <RID>` is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information.

An alternative to this would be a Python script from Impacket called samrdump.py.

The information we have already obtained with `rpcclient` can also be obtained using other tools. For example, the [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap) and [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.
